### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this challenge I learned 

- how to work with grid-area and use template columns and rows depending on needs and design matchin. 
- Learned how margin auto works and the benefit of it in moving some elements inside containers.


- This code was to move the image from left to right, if I understood correctly, the auto stretches and eliminate empty spacing automatically.
```css
.main-cards {
    img {
        margin-left: auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
In my future projects I will focus on:

- Trying to find more useful cases in using auto property.
- Explore more Flexbox and Grid propreties and find good use for them.
- Improve my SASS nesting and clean structure without over complicating the main CSS stylesheet.
